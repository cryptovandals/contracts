# The Cryptovandals Manifesto

NFTs promise a new online world, one that recaptures the ambitions of the internet of the 1990sâ€”a cyberspace where its own [Declaration of Independence](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) is a founding document. In that world, the platform empires' walls have crumbled and their rulers can no longer monetize our creativity and attention. NFTs promise abundance for both creators and audiences: For audiences, the abundance of open access rather than the algorithmic grip of adtech surveillance and paywalls. For creators, a direct connection to audiences and a fair share of the value of their work.

The NFT world we are building breaks those promises. Aspiring Instagrams are plotting to coopt the momentum of the NFT revolution. They talk about decentralization and open standards while building new walls to replace the old ones, hoping to trap creators and audiences in a marketplace garden. They want to leverage NFTs to build their own platform empires. 

NFTs promised **ownership**, but the NFT platforms offered restrictive licensing terms.

NFTs promised **immutability**, but the NFT platforms built gateways that allow creations to be replaced, removed, or lost.

NFTs promised **openness**, but the NFT platforms built restrictive APIs and data access.

**Broken links, broken terms, broken promises.**

We must liberate our NFTs from single points of failure and control.

**We need [Cryptovandals](https://cryptovandals.com).**
